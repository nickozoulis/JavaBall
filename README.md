JavaBall Match Referee Allocation

A project assigned during the first week of my master degree in order to get our programming skills assessed. We had 4 days to develop an application using a platform of our choice. Basically it is an app that finds and assigns suitable referees to javaball matches (suitability is based on 3 level of ordering). The input of the app is in specific format, and must be located in sd card/javaball/, in a file named 'RefereesIn.txt'. 

<i>Example of RefereesIn.txt</i>


<p>DG1 Dave Gray NJB2 3 Central NYY</p>
<p>DM1 Denis Montague IJB1 3 North YYY</p>
<p>JL1 Jack Low IJB2 2 South NYY</p>
<p>KL1 Kenneth Lorrimer IJB2 6 South YYY</p>
<p>KL2 Kenneth Lindsay NJB3 12 Central YYY</p>
<p>TT1 Tim Toms IJB1 Central NYN</p>


PS: Sory, but no time for full documentation if 4 days :D
